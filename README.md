Slides companion to Relay Modern Course

## How to run it?

check package.json there is one yarn script for each lesson

`yarn setup` is first one

`yarn simulated-defer` is the last one for now

## Is there videos that accompany slides?
Not yet, if I receive enough donations to buy a microphone I will record the course.

Who donated will have the course for free
